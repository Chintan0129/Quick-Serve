Hello my self chintan shah.
I have created shopping cart website named MobileDukan.
Features of my websites are as follows:

---

password:(for admin: email:admin@gmail.com password:Saibaba@24 ) (user :you can register or use existing user email:abcd@gmail.com password:Saibaba@24 , email:test@gmail.com password:Chintan@24).

1. One can register themselves and then login to use this website.
2. also user can add item before logging and with the help of cookie we can fetch the same product details after login.
3. Also one can update the profile and delete the profile.
4. Also one can filter product as per the price range.
5. past orders can be visible on that section with full details of products and Delivery agent also .
6. also user get products as per the \*\*(ranked assigned) ,the concept is fetching the most ranked product first from table and then fetch as per the ranking order.So most ranked product is visible to user rather than going and searching it.
7. Also the same is true for category page,if same products then show users top ranked product first ,though here there are few items ,but \*\*(if many items are there than this concept is useful.)
8. Also there is product view page ,this mainly for reading description of product and its rank.Also here one can add comments and see the comments also .
9. there is order detail form and most details are fetched from users table only address filed is left and user can place order.
10. make website fully responsive from front as well as admin panel
11. Admin-side
    1.update the product
    2.delete the product
    3.delete the users
    4.update the order status
    5.add product
    Try to complete the checklist given.Also add comments where needed.
12. database 6 tables :- Admin table,sc_users table,product table,cart table,order table,comments.
    ***
13. - Future work::
      extra features not given in checklist:(make website open for multivendor)
      I am working on this website for adding feature such that multiple admin can login and add product and they only show the data of their own ,also i understand the logic only thing is add adminid as common filed on product and order table and then fetch the admin or its company name for user on frontend so user also understand ,whom they buy product.Also working on this and try to complete this .
